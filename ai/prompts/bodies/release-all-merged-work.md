Verify and release all merged but unreleased work currently on `main`.

Use `ai/RELEASES.md`.
Include every merged PR and executed `ai/PLAN_*.md` file that belongs to the unreleased change set.
If any included work is not release-ready, stop and list blockers first instead of preparing a partial release.
If the merged work is ready, prepare the release commit, archive every included executed plan under `ai/archive/`, create the annotated tag, push the release commit and tag, and verify remote publication.
Summarize exactly which merged PRs and executed plan files were included.
